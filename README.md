# sale-watcher (WIP)

Checks a list of sites with provided CSS identifiers for prices, reruns daily and notifies the user of any price drops

Very basic atm for a bit of a hack

## TODO

- Docker support ✅
- Nix dev env ✅
- Move docker build to nix (maybe) 🤕
- Multiple email support
- Database instead of JSON file
- API so that we don't have to manually input new entries
- Frontend
